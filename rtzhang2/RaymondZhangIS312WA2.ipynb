    "Academic examinations are employed by almost all educational programs across the world, and come in a variety of different configurations. These can range from a quick daily quiz on the previous lecture material to a cumulative marathon scantron encompassing a semester's worth of content. It's almost guaranteed that a test that a student takes in his lifetime will each be unique from all others from the past. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, for almost all tests, there is a general strategy for success that seems to be replicatable for basically everyone. If one was to go around and ask other students how they are able to succeed on tests, the advice would be relatively summed up by these three points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Learn new material. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Review/relearn past material as you progress into newer material.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Practice answering questions that emulate those from the test. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would make sense too — if we were to take a panel of top scorers from the AP Calculus BC exam from last year, it is sensible these students knew the material well, relearned/reviewed older material, and practiced MCQ and FRQ questions from past years. \n",
    "\n",
    "An exam called the Evaluación de Bachillerato para el Acceso a la Universidad (EBAU), which is also better known as the Selectividad, is a college-entrance exam and verification of completion of secondary school that is taken by students after finishing the equivalent of high school. A mark on the Selectividad can make or break a student's future in higher education, so doing well is vital. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the general strategy drawn above can easily be disrupted. Here are some examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) John is a high school senior in Calculus. He transferred from a country that did not require anything above the equivalent of Algebra I to be taken. As such, the highest level of math John knows is Alg I. John subsequently cannot even complete 1) because he is unable to learn due to the fact that he lacks a foundation in mathematics. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Ben is a classmate of John, also a senior, but has been attending school in the area since 1st grade. He has all the Precalc prereqs to learn new material, but the course materials and resources are online, and Ben does not have a computer at home, meaning his ability to review on his own time is limited to when he is at school or at the library / coffee shop. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Peter is also a classmate of John and Ben. Senior, attending school in the area since 1st grade. While Peter is the most prepared of the three, he is unable to practice test questions because this year, the Calculus exam has been majorly revamped. Suddenly, all the questions are different enough that the last test's questions are inadequate. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, it becomes apparent that being able to predict test scores from demographics could allow intervention during the learning process to hopefully improve scores in the future, rather than finding out later that students were struggling and recieving disappointing scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was obtained from Kaggle.com's extensive supply of datasets, and contains 4,000 anonymized datapoints containing fields about a student's demographic information (Gender, HoursStudied/Week, Tutoring?, Urban/Rural, Attendance Rate, Highest Level of Parent Education) as well as respective student's mark on the Selectividad. While this dataset is pretty great, there were about 422 datapoints that were dropped because they were missing data in some fields. This can be considered a considerable portion of the original data that was trimmed away, and this is my disclaimer, if this trimming has any statistically significant impact on the findings. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project and literate programming document, methods, and its findings are targetted towards parents, educators, and governments. It should serve to inform and guide future actions, policies, and regulations in the common interest for a smarter and more capable next generation of minds. "

    "My prediction is that, on average, classifying as RURAL, NO for Tutoring, Primary for ParentEdu, or having low HoursPerWeekStudy will decrease the average score. If we really dumb these down, on average, we would likely expect that a large number of students with ALL of these traits will have low average scores. \n",

I'm not going to list them all out, but the general trend is that higher parental education level is correlated with an *appreciable* increase in Selectividad test score.\n",

For the sake of simplicity, I have done one model using linear regression, and one with logistic regression. Usually with simpler datasets like the one I'm using, a simpler model will more than suffice. From my experience, using too complex of a model on a simple dataset wastes time and compute, all to end up with the linear regression model doing better with absoletely zero optimization. \n",

    "Since Attendance and Tutoring are much better predictors on whether a student does well or not compared to variables like Sex or Parental Education, we should push for school districts and governments to fight for funds. These funds should be allocated to peer tutoring programs or in the best case, hiring \"professionals\" as tutors. Additionally, there should be much more attention paid into how to increase attendance rates. Unfortunately, we cannot eliminate disease as a reason for skipping, but if a student simply decides not to show up for no reason, this can be avoided. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day, while the job of a school and teachers is to put math, science, english, etc. into the brains of the next generation, it's ultimately up to the students to open their minds up. But yet again, different students have different interests, which is why schools need increased funding from the government or literally anyone who can provide, so that schools can open a wide variety of high quality programs. If a student shows an apptitude for music yet is forced into track and field, it's like putting a saltwater fish into freshwater. With more programs, an art student CAN become an artist, and a STEM student CAN become an engineer or chemist, and neither is forced into something they are not, which ultimately also will drive attendance, and therefore test scores in the Selectividad.

    "*The chosen dataset of test scores in Spain and a variety of demographic information is interesting and I’m curious to see what you will find with further analysis. The code works so far, as long as the csv file is downloaded previously onto the computer of whoever is running the program. \n",
    "One area of improvement might be being more clear about who your audience is; like if it is parents trying to figure out how they can help their kids test scores, or teachers, or even students. Another area could be working on what the audience should do with the information. For example, if you find that students from a certain area have better scores, are you going to encourage people to move there or to look into the school and see what they may be doing differently? I think your planned outline structure is good, and covers everything you will need from the Intro, to EDA, to methodology ,etc. I would also recommend having the argument clearly stated before the data analysis as well, so it can be in the Introduction section, and then this is proven by the data through your analysis.*"
